This is a simple project I've made with PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap. It takes the user input from form, stores it on a database and displays it on a seperate page. Sadly GitHub pages only allow static content, so i've created this gif to show you how it works! ![cinnamon-20220422-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101229677/164607516-0b5cbc02-a95c-4f50-9dfe-56a0da2520f4.gif)
The project can also be viewed online [here](https://warmjuly.github.io/feedback/).
